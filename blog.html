								<div class="project-content">
                                <p>This analysis was built to help a potential Airbnb host answer the golden question: "How much can I 
                                    actually make?" Using a dataset split into three tables—listings, reviews, and calendar—I explored patterns 
                                    using Tableau.
                                    First, I visualized price distribution by ZIP code, both as a bar chart and on a map, highlighting 
                                    high-value areas. I then analyzed the calendar data using line graphs to understand price trends 
                                    week by week over multiple years. It helped answer questions like: When’s the best time to list?                                  
                                    Digging deeper, I explored revenue potential by property type. I found that one-bedroom listings 
                                    had the highest total earnings overall—over $63 million in daily revenue—but that was due to 
                                    sheer volume (1,800+ listings). In contrast, a 6-bedroom home averaged $584 per night, meaning 
                                    a host could earn nearly $500 in just one night. This kind of insight is gold for anyone 
                                    considering what kind of property to list.                                  
                                    A filter table showing the number of listings by bedroom count helped put it all in context, 
                                    giving a full picture of supply vs. earning potential.

                                <p>This project explored a dataset collected via an online survey of data professionals, covering 
                                    everything from job roles to satisfaction with work-life balance. The aim was to present the 
                                    experience and realities of data careers in an intuitive dashboard.
                                    Data cleaning was done in Power Query, where I grouped similar responses, split complex fields 
                                    using delimiters, and extracted meaningful values. For example, survey responses like "Other 
                                    (please specify)" were separated to isolate relevant insights. I also transformed textual ranges 
                                    like "70K–90K" into numerical averages using custom formulas.
                                    <p>The dashboard includes:</p>

								<div class="project-content">
                                <p>In this project, I took on the challenge of cleaning a real-world dataset of global layoffs 
                                    using SQL—a key part of preparing data for deeper analysis. The raw data had no primary key, 
                                    inconsistent entries, and a lot of duplication.
                                    <p><b>Step 1: Remove Duplicates </b><br/>
                                        I created a duplicate of the table and used a Common Table Expression (CTE) with ROW_NUMBER() 
                                        partitioned by all columns. This let me flag duplicates—any row with a number greater than 1. 
                                        Because direct deletion via CTE wasn’t allowed, I created a secondary table with the row numbers 
                                        and deleted rows based on that. <br/>

                                        <b>Step 2: Standardize Data </b><br/>
                                        I used TRIM() functions to clean whitespace, then identified and merged similar but inconsistently 
                                        named entries (e.g., “Google Inc.” vs. “Google”).<br/>

                                        <b>Step 3: Handle Null Values </b><br/>
                                        To fill missing data, I created two versions of the table and used JOIN operations where one had nulls 
                                        and the other didn’t, then updated missing values accordingly.<br/>

                                        <b>Step 4: Drop Unnecessary Columns</b><br/>
                                        After cleaning, I dropped helper columns and columns with excessive null values that offered little 
                                        analytical value. The result? A clean, standardized dataset ready for dashboards or machine learning

                                <p>Fires remain a major cause of residential fatalities, especially when no one is home to respond to a 
                                    traditional alarm. To tackle this, I built a fire detection system using IoT and automation 
                                    technologies that not only detects fire outbreaks but also sends emergency alerts to homeowners and 
                                    relevant authorities via the internet.
                                    The system is built around a Raspberry Pi 3, chosen for its flexibility and GPIO support, acting as 
                                    the core microprocessor. It gathers data from a DHT11 sensor (for humidity and temperature) and an 
                                    MQ135 gas sensor (to detect harmful gases and smoke). A USB camera captures real-time images of the 
                                    environment, and a buzzer sounds a physical alarm on-site. All data and imagery are sent to Amazon 
                                    Web Services, enabling remote monitoring.                                   
                                    This solution bridges the gap between early detection and emergency response, ensuring safety even in
                                    the absence of occupants. It also laid the groundwork for a more intelligent, AI-enhanced version of

                                <p>This project is a personal favorite—it combines machine learning, IoT, and full-stack development to 
                                    support preventive healthcare. I built a system to predict hypertension (a key risk factor for heart 
                                    attacks) using both user-provided lifestyle data and real-time sensor inputs. <br/>

                                    The frontend is a React web application where users log weekly data including smoking habits, physical 
                                    activity, alcohol consumption, and diet. This data is stored and timestamped in Firebase Firestore, 
                                    enabling time-series analysis. The system is also equipped to receive live vitals such as blood 
                                    pressure from wearable IoT sensors. <br/>
                                    
                                    On the backend, I trained a scikit-learn machine learning model using two datasets: the UCI Heart 
                                    Disease dataset and the CDC BRFSS dataset. The model classifies users as hypertensive or not, 
                                    combining behavioral and physiological features for a more holistic prediction. <br/>
                                    
                                    The prediction results are presented in an intuitive dashboard, helping users track their heart 
                                    health over time. I used Notion for project management, breaking development into five parts: 
                                    Firebase integration, sensor module, model training, frontend UI, and system integration. <br/>
                                    
                                    This project reinforced my understanding of health tech, full-stack architecture, and practical ML 
                                    deployment in real-world systems.
